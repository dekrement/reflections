When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I work with a team or I want my project to be reachable on many machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I want to decide for myself when I need to pull changes and when I'm not ready.
